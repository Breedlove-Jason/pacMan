An in-depth look at building the traditional arcade style PacMan game using python and the pygame library.

## Notes:

## Bugs:
    
- fixed starting enemies are off position
- fixed bug in wall generation
- when pacman starts the game on the top row he goes through the walls until user moves him then the walls function correctly returns
- might adjust the background image to reflect the outer walls correctly
- could try and center the first column on the left as it appears just slightly off but it may be more likely that the image is just not complete
- fixed p_pos variable working but player not changing start vector
